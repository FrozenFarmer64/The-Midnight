*The Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...  
This is the official wiki for The Midnight mod, originally made for SpookyJam 2018.
